You are also encouraged to install nodemon to speed up your development. nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

nodemon does **not** require *any* additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for `node`. To use `nodemon`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

And nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.
